#Nautical Navigation Project – Kaan Aksoy

#Description
This program is a simple nautical navigation software that the user can use to get nautical information like windspeed, temperature, wave height, locations of boats in the vicinity of a plotted point, and other information that could be acquired from nautical charts.
The user will import the nautical chart for the desired area, and the corner coordinates of the imported chart. Then the program will overlay weather information, and if desired, other boat activity. The user will be able to plot a deired path, and then the program will give the user the length for the desired route.
